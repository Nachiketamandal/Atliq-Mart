Hello Everyone,
This is my another Power BI dashboard. This time I have used Atliq Mart FMCG Manufacturing Data Analysis from Codebasics  resume project challenge.  
Thank you Dhaval Patel & Hemanand Vadivel for taking the initiative of helping people in building a portfolio with projects like this. Looking forward for your feedback and suggestions. This is my first submission for Code Basics Challenges.

For this challenge, the dataset from the FMCG manufacturer is provided by the Codebasics team to perform Supply Chain Analytics. The primary task is to track five main 𝐊𝐏𝐈𝐬.
★ OT % - On time delivery percentage
★ IF % - In Full delivery percentage
★ OTIF % - On time and In Full delivery percentage
★ LIFR - Line Fill Rate
★ VOFR - Volume Fill Rate

𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐛𝐥𝐞𝐦 𝐒𝐭𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭: A few key customers haven't renewed the annual contract due to the service issues. This might have resulted in the bad service experience. Hence, the management wants to track the "On-Time" & In-Full" delivery service levels for all the customers on daily basis to fix them and later expand the business to new cities.

𝐓𝐚𝐬𝐤: As a data analyst, I need to create the dashboard with the relevant metrics as per business requirements and bring out the valuable insights from the data and help supply chain team to retain the customers and expand the business.


This challenge helped me in,
☞ Gaining sufficient domain knowledge in supply chain and its terms. 
☞ Designing the dashboard with bookmarks and advanced visual formatting and features. 
☞ Writing complex DAX measures for visuals and conditional formatting.
☞ Usage of Buttons and hover effect to play around some visuals.
☞ Creating a slicer panel, with buttons to open/close, and also a display to show the selected data filters on the page.

♦ Creating DAX to view the applied filters on the slicer panel was challenging.



This challenge has leveraged me in learning complex DAX and date functions, playing around with the visuals with error bars and bookmarks was fun.
